    <!-- The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky). -->
    <!-- position: static;
HTML elements are positioned static by default.
Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
This <div> element has position: static; -->

    <!-- position: relative;
An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. -->
